Rails App for FPHS (Zeus)
==================

The **Zeus** App provides CRM and activity tracking functionality for the
Football Players Health Study (FPHS) team.

Build, test and deployment is by Ansible, with full details here:

The same Ansible roles can be used to create a self-contained Vagrant server for
development, avoiding the need to get all the prerequisites satisfied locally.
