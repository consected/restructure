      <i>[For those who scored &lt;= 19 on the T-MoCA ONLY]</i>

      The next step of this screening process is to speak to a close family member who knows you well or someone who can legally make decisions for you to ask them questions about your memory. For example, we will ask them to tell us if you need reminders or help with activities such as keeping track of appointments, household chores and personal care. We will also ask them to tell us about your mood â€“ for example, if you get anxious or irritated. This will entail a brief phone call with the individual you decide to provide contact information for. Following the phone call, we will send them an individualized link via email which will contain a 23 -question survey. This survey will not contain any identifiable information â€“ for instance, it will not contain your name, address, or birthdate and your family member will not be asked to provide this information either.

      Do we have your permission to speak to someone that knows you well?
