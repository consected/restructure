# User Guide

## Introduction

The Study app provides a user interface that is easy to use without specific training. The approach is to present a complete view of the large number of records and activities related to a participant in a compact way.

The common components of the user interface are:

- [Login](login)
- Search and Work Queues
- Participant Record
- Reports
- Emails and SMS notifications
- Change Password
- Logout

Additional information for your current app: [{{current_user_app_type_label}}](/help/app_reference/{{current_user_app_type_name::lowercase::id_underscore}}/0_introduction)

## User Profiles

Users are provided access to login to the application server, and from here are granted access to specific study apps and functionality dependent on their roles. An app administrator provides appropriate access through configurations.
