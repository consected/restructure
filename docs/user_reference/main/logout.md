# Logout

It is important to logout when you have finished using the application, to ensure your account and data remains secure. Closing the browser tab or window is not normally sufficient to end your session.

## Logout

To logout, simply click the user icon at the right-hand end of the top navigation bar to show the user options.

Click **logout** to complete the logout. You will be returned to a login page when you are logged out.

## Session Timeout

If no actions are performed within the app for a period of time, the the app will automatically log out. This is to protect against accidentally forgetting to logout, and avoid unauthorized users accessing the application if left unattended for a length of time.

Typically you will be presented with a warning banner giving you the chance to continue work if this is not intended. Click the **Continue working** button to prevent the automatic logout.

**NOTE:** other open tabs may continue to show the warning banner. Click **Continue working** in these will not cause any harm.
