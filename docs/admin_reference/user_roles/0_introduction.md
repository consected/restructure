# User Roles

## Introduction

**User Roles** are used to represent the roles a user performs within an app, and groups specific functionality available.

A *User Role* may be used to:

- Assign [user access controls](../user_access_controls/0_introduction.md)
- Set specific [app configurations](../app_configurations/0_introduction.md) to be used
- Authorize access to specific Filestore containers and [file filters](../file_filters/0_introduction.md)
- Enable [activity log](../activity_log/0_introduction.md) process functionality, such as discussions and notifications, defined with the process configuration

Administration is provided in [Admin: User Roles](/admin/user_roles)
