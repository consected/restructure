# Reports

*User Access Controls* for *reports* grant users access to individual reports, charts and dashboard elements.

Access is must be set to *read* to allow the report to be viewed. If a user does not have access to a report, via a *User Role* or directly having a *User* entry, the user will not be able to see the report in any report index list, or be able to view the report through a direct link.

When selecting a report in the *Resource Name* field, all reports are listed, grouped by category.
