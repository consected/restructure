# Administration Guide

## Introduction

Administrators are super-users within the application environment. An administrator has a range of responsibilities, from managing users through to configuration of new data structures and processes.

## Administrator Users

Administrators are a separate class of profile from regular app users. An administrator should also have a user account set up, with a username that matches the administrator account.

## Operating System Administrators

Some administration tasks, such as creation of new administrators and re-enabling previously disabled admins, can only be performed by users with access to the app server operating system. Details are found in [Manage Administrators](/help/admin_reference/admins/0_introduction.md).

## Developers

A separate developer's reference, including API samples, is available in the [Dev Reference](/help/dev_reference/main/README)
