# Administration Guide

## Introduction

Administrators are super-users within the application environment. An administrator has a range of responsibilities, from managing users through to configuration of new data structures and processes.

## Administrator Users

Administrators are a separate class of profile from regular app users. An administrator should also have a user account set up, with a username that matches the administrator account.
