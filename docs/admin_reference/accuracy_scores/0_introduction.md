# Accuracy Scores

## Introduction

**Accuracy Scores** provide a mechanism for ranking the accuracy of a participant's information. This is particularly useful when participant data is captured from external sources and its accuracy must be verified by users prior to use.

Administration is provided in [Classification: Accuracy Score](/admin/accuracy_scores)

## Details

**Accuracy Scores** are associated with the primary participant information data model, set by the application server administrator. Any admin can edit and add new accuracy scores.
