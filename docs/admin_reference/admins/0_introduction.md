# Manage Administrators

## Introduction

Administrators are able to perform a limited set of functions to manage other administrator profiles. This includes:

- Changing first and last names
- Resetting passwords
- Resetting two-factor authentication
- Disabling currently active administrators
- Changing email address (username) - for other admins only

Administrator profiles can not be re-enabled after having been previously disabled through the user interface. This requires an authorized operating system admin.

## Operating System Administrators

Some administration tasks, such as creation of new administrators and re-enabling previously disabled admins, can only be performed by users with access to the app server operating system.

See [Create an admin user or reset an admin account](create_admin.md) for details
