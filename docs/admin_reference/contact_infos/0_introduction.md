# Contact Information

## Introduction

**Contact information** can be added to individual user accounts, providing:

- SMS number
- Phone number
- Alternative email address

Administration is provided in [Contact Information](/users/contact_infos)

## SMS Number

If an SMS number is specified, it is assumed that the user has consented to receive SMS messages as notifications from specific apps.

SMS numbers must be entered as `+cccnnnnnnnnnnn`

- **+ccc** represents the 1 to 3 digit country code, prefixed with a + symbol
- **nnnnnnnnnn** represents the full phone number

## Phone Number

The phone number is used for display purposes within apps, to allow a user's phone number to be presented. This is a plain text entry field, and will be presented exactly as entered.

## Alternative Email

Some users may prefer to be emailed at an address that is
different to their username email address. Setting this allows specific apps to display this alternative email to other users or within scripts. It does not change the address that application notifications are sent to.
