# Trouble Logging In?

If you are having trouble logging in, check you have followed the [login information](README.md), especially if this is your first time logging in.

The first time you login you should *not* enter anything in the **Two-Factor Authentication Code** field. For subsequent logins, sometimes it is necessary to close the authenticator app on your mobile device and reopen it to get it to refresh correctly.

If you were allowed to register as a user without administrator assistance, you should receive a confirmation email with instructions for your first login.
