# Trouble Logging In?

If you are having trouble logging in, check you have followed the [login information](README), especially if this is your first time logging in.

The first time you login you should *not* enter anything in the **Two-Factor Authentication Code** field. For subsequent logins, sometimes it is necessary to close the authenticator app on your mobile device and reopen it to get it to refresh correctly.

Still having login issues, or have definitely forgotten your password or lost your two-factor authentication: [reset your account login]({{login_issues_url}})
