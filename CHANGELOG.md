# Changelog for ReStructure

This file documents notable changes to the ReStructure project.

The format of this file is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

In short this means that version numbers, visible here and on the login page of the
app match, and have a predictable format indicating how much change from the previous
version has occurred.

The [Unreleased](#unreleased) section collects notes for unreleased changes and features, until they are absorbed into a formal release in a version number tagged section below.

Note that not every tagged version may be suitable for production use. A Github
release will be created for any release tested in production, and may be marked below with the tag [Release]
