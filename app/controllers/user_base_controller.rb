# Base (abstract) class for virutally all controllers that are to be accessed by a user.
# Its primary responsibilities are:
# - enforcement of authentication
# - search and filtering of results
# - model name resolution based on the controller name
# - handling app type changes requested by a user
class UserBaseController < ApplicationController
  #
  # Provide a forgery protection strategy that recognizes if a request is attempting to use
  # an API user_token, and if so disables CSRF. The user_token has to be correct for the request
  # to actually pass. If a X-CSRF-Token header is provided and is correct, this will override the
  # user_token and the request will be treated as a browser request. If it is not correct, the user_token must be
  # If neither user_token or X-CSRF-Token header are provided then the request will fail.
  #
  # It is expected that this strategy will be extended when JWT or another API request style is implemented.
