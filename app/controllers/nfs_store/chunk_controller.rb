  # Manage the upload of fixed length data chunks for large file uploads.
  #
  # Each upload from a client can consist of one or more files, each sent as one or more chunks.
  # The reason for splitting files into chunks is it allows easy progress feedback from the server,
  # and in the case of failures, allows large file uploads to be restarted.
  # Multiple files may be uploaded as a batch, since we may require a notification to users to be
  # triggered one time after all the files have been uploaded, rather than for each individual file.
