  # Use popen to create a subprocess connected to Ruby through a pipe:
  # optionally sends results to the pipe, receives results from the pipe
  #
  # Send to pipe (no initial piped in data):
  #     res = ProcessPipes.pipe_in_out nil, ['echo', 'AB 123 456 789']
  #
  # Receive result from pipe chain:
  #     res = ProcessPipes.pipe_in_out res, ['wc']
  #
  # Send and receive together do the equivalent of `echo AB 123 456 789' | wc`
  #
  # To chain 3 commands:
  #
  #     res = ProcessPipes.pipe_in_out nil, ['echo', 'ABC12345 234234 24523']
  #     ProcessPipes.pipe_in_out res, ['wc']
  #     ProcessPipes.pipe_in_out res, ['grep', '1']
  #
  # This does the equivalent of `echo 'ABC12345 234234 24523' | wc | grep '1'`
