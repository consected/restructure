  fields:
  - field_name_1
  - field_name_2
  caption_before:
    field_name: |
      String caption to appear before field. Use markdown formatting if needed.

      [Substitutions](../general/substitutions.md) of data can be performed with `\{\{data_attribute\}\}` notation.
    all_fields: caption to appear before all fields
    submit: caption to appear before submit button
    field_to_retain_label:
      keep_label: true
      caption: caption to appear before label
    field_with_different_views:
      show_caption: caption in show mode
      edit_caption: caption in edit mode
      new_caption: caption in new mode
    reference_with_reference_name: |
      add caption above a reference action / list where
      the reference is named reference_<reference name>
  labels:
    field_name: label to show
  show_if:
    field_name:
      depends_on_field_name: conditional value
      current_mode: show | edit
  view_options:
    show_embedded_at_top: |
      true | false to position a single auto loaded embedded item
    hide_unless_creatable: |
      true | false to hide add-item buttons in activity logs if
      they are not creatable
    data_attribute: string or list of fields to use as the data attribute
    always_embed_reference: reference name to always show embedded (or 'never' to never embed one)
    always_embed_creatable_reference: |
      reference name to always show embedded during
      new/create (or 'never' to never embed one)
    alt_order: string or list of date / time or integer fields to use for ordering
    show_cancel: show cancel button alongside save button
    only_create_as_reference: |
      prevent creation as a standalone item, only embedded
      / referenced within another
    sort_references: 
      # Sort model references in an alternative order, using the specified model_reference attribute      
      # Typically this will be "id" to sort by when the reference was created, as opposed to the
      # typical sorting which groups references in the order of their definition.
      # NOTE: this setting may override *order_by:* specified for a specific *references:* configuration 
      attribute: |
        one of: id, from_record_type, from_record_id, from_record_master_id, to_record_type, to_record_id, 
        to_record_master_id, user_id, created_at, updated_at, disabled      
      direction: |
        Default is ascending sort. To reverse the sort order use
        "desc" or "reverse" for descending results
      keep_top: |
        If the sorting moves the top item that you want to keep in place, set this to *true*
      null_value: |
        If sorting items that may have a null value in the specified attribute, this specifies the value
        to use for the comparison of that item

    view_handlers: |
      name of handler for UI, and models if they exist 
      (prebuilt UI and model options include: address, contact, subject, secondary_info)
    header_caption: header caption to use - can include [substitutions](../general/substitutions.md)
    alt_width_classes: html classes (space separated) to replace standard col-* classes
      # For example:
      #   resized-width col-md-18 col-lg-18 col-md-offset-3 prevent_nfs_resize
      # This forces the width of the block, and prevents the NFS filestore block changing the container width
    extra_class: html classes (space separated) to add to block
      # Useful classes:
      # - allow-refresh-item-on-modal-close
      #   - to ensure an embedded_report_* field refreshes the block when the modal is closed
      # - prevent-reload-on-reference-save
      #   - by default the container will reload when a reference is created or updated. This prevents it
      # - no-scroll-on-click-edit
      #   - prevent scrolling to this item if edit is clicked (manually or automatically)
      # - make-labels-placeholders
      #   - show fields with in field placeholders rather than labels
      # - hide-form-metadata
      #   - hides the form metadata in edit mode

  filestore:
    container: {}

      create_next_creatable:
        if: 'ref: ** conditions reference **'
      show_panel:
        value: panel / category name

        - value: panel / category name
          if: 'ref: ** conditions reference **'
      expand_reference:
        - value: reference with caption - the option *if:* means the first matched item will be used as the value
          if: 'ref: ** conditions reference **'
        - value: next - this literal value tells the action to open the next available reference tab
          if: 'ref: ** conditions reference **'
    on_create: {}
    on_save:
      notes: |
        on_save: provides a shorthand for on_create and on_update. on_create
        and on_update override on_save configurations.
  field_options:
    field_name:
      include_blank: |
        true or false to force a drop down field to include a selectable
        blank
      pattern: provide a mask for a text field
      value: |
        default value | now() | today() 
        
        NOTE this is set in the form fields UI only if the item has not yet been created and no preset_value has been set.
        It is not set before building the instances, so will not be available for data conditions.
      blank_value: |
        default value | now() | today() 
        
        NOTE this is set in the form fields UI only if the item has been created and the current value is blank.
        It is not set before building the instances, so will not be available for data conditions.
      preset_value: |
        default value | now() | today() 
        
        NOTE this is set when building the instances and may be used to drive logic like an embed_resource_name field
      no_downcase: true - to prevent downcasing of the attribute when stored to the database
      view_original_case: true - to prevent the UI capitalizing downcased fields
      format: plain | markdown - for free text editor fields such as notes and description
      config:
        _comment: additional configurations for editor fields
        toolbar_type: advanced - adds in additional editor toolbar controls
      edit_as:
        field_type: alternative field name to use for selection of edit field
        alt_options: |
          optional specification of options for a select_ type field to
          use instead of general selection specified list. {Label: value, ...} or [Label,...].
          For the latter the Label is downcased automatically to generate the value
        
        # For select_record_* fields:
        general_selection: |
          use a general selection definition with an alternative name, or belonging to a
          different prefix name
        value_attr: attribute_name to use for selection value in select_record_* fields
        label_attr: attribute_name to use for selection label in select_record_* fields
        group_split_char: optional character to split on when grouping selections in select_record_* fields
        no_assoc: | 
          false | true - optionally specify that no association should be used in select_record_* data lookup
                         select_record_from_table_* automatically sets this to true
                         select_record_from_* defaults to false but this setting overrides the default
      calculate_with:
        sum: []
      prompt: used by some select fields for the placeholder prompt text
      use_app_type: |
        use the specified app type id or name instead of the user's current app type
        to filter protocol (and in the future other) selections
  dialog_before:
    field_name:
      name: message template name
      label: show dialog button label
    all_fields:
      name: message template name
      label: show dialog button label

      label: show dialog button label
  creatable_if: 'ref: ** conditions reference **'
  editable_if: |
    'ref: ** conditions reference **'

    NOTE: if not defined, the default is to only allow an item to be editable if it is the most recently created or
    item in the list. If you want items to be always editable, use *always: true*

  showable_if: 'ref: ** conditions reference **'
  add_reference_if: 'ref: ** conditions reference **'
  valid_if:
    on_save: ''
    on_create:

  embed:
    resource_name: resource name for the item to embed
    resource_id: |
      (optional) literal integer or a named attribute on the resource to use as an id of the embedded item

      When not specified, the embedded item is looked up based on the existence of a foreign key
      field in the target direct embed table pointing back to the parent record. The foreign key
      field is named "<singularized parent table name>_id"
    limit: (optional) default 1 - although other values may be set, the aim is not really to use direct embedded items for this

    # NOTE: direct embed may be configured either using this *embed:* configuration, or directly
    # defining fields on the parent and optionally target tables.
    # An advantage of using fields on the parent table is that the target embed resource may be specified on a
    # record by record basis.
    # To define an embedded item using fields alone, use one of the following field configurations:
    # <parent table>: embed_resource_name, embed_resource_id - directly reference the embedded item
    # <parent table>: embed_resource_name, <target embed table>: <singularized parent table name>_id - foreign key reference.
    # Whichever way an embedded item is specified,
    # `\{\{substitutions\}\}` may reference attributes in it item using `\{\{embedded_item.<attribute name>\}\}`
