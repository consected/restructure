You completed<br\/> the first health and wellness questionnaire (Q1) and are being invited to complete additional surveys in order to assess health over time. We are inviting all former NFL players who completed Q1 to complete additional questionnaires as<br\/>  part of a longitudinal cohort study. These questionnaires capture basic health information from former professional<br\/> football players like you and enables our study team to build a foundation of knowledge on former player health. <br\/>Responses from the first questionnaire informed the development of Q2 and the direction of the study's research.\r\n\r\n<b><i>What should I know about the Football Players Health Study?<\/b><\/i> \r\n<ul><li>You may contact the study team of the Football Players Health Study if you have any questions.<\/li><li>Whether you participate in the Study is up to you.<\/li><li>You can choose not to take part in the Study.<\/li><li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.<\/li><li>Your decision will not be held against you and will not affect your medical treatment or any outside litigation.<\/li><li>You may discuss your decision with your family, your friends and\/or your doctor.<\/li><li>You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.<\/li><\/ul><b><i>Why is this research being done?<\/b><\/i>\r\nThis research is being done to better understand how playing football can affect the health status of former players. <br\/>With as many participants as possible, we can gather data about the health conditions most common and most<br\/> important to former players like yourself and use that information to direct the future research questions of the study.\r\n\r\n<b><i>How long will I take part in this research?<\/b><\/i>\r\n Q2 should take 30-40 minutes but may depend on how quickly you read and answer questions. You may exit the<br\/> survey and return to complete it at a later time. You will be given a survey return code, and you may contact the study<br\/> team if you lose your return code.\r\n\r\nYou may be contacted to complete follow-up questionnaires as part of the Football Players Health Study at Harvard University.\r\n\r\nAs part of the questionnaire(s), you will be asked to complete a series of questions aiming to understand your current <br\/>state of health and well-being and your health history. The questionnaire(s) may also ask about your professional<br\/> football experience and changes in your health, thinking, and lifestyle. You may answer or skip any questions you <br\/>would like.\r\n\r\nMore detailed information about the study procedures can be found under the <i>\"What can I expect if I take part in this research?\"<\/i> section.\r\n\r\n<b><i>Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?<\/b><\/i>\r\nAs with any collection of data, there is a potential for loss of privacy and confidentiality. We will take all reasonable<br\/> steps to protect the privacy of the study participants. It is also possible that some of the questions may cause<br\/> discomfort or emotional distress. We have included more detail about these steps below in the <i>\"What are the risks<br\/> and possible discomforts?\"<\/i> section.\r\n\r\n<b><i>Will being in this study help me in any way?<\/b><\/i>\r\nThere are no direct benefits to you from your participation in this research. We cannot promise any benefits to others<br\/> from your participation in this research. However, by giving us a better understanding of your life and health status, it<br\/> is the starting point for developing follow-up studies to assess various health problems of former players in more detail.<br\/> We hope that this work will lead to earlier interventions for football-related health problems, minimize long-term health problems, and lead to a better quality of life for former players, as well as for future generations of players.\r\n\r\n<b><i>What happens if I do not want to be in this research? <\/b><\/i>\r\nParticipation in research is completely voluntary. You can decide to participate or not to participate. Your alternative to participating in this research study is to not participate.\r\n\r\n<center><b>Detailed Information<\/b><\/center>To follow, please find more detailed information about this study than already provided above.\r\n\r\n<b>About this consent form<\/b>\r\nPlease read this form carefully.

If you<br\/> wish to speak with someone from the IRB, you may contact the Office of Human Research Administration (OHRA) <br\/>at 617-432-2157 (or toll-free at 1-866-606-0573) or at <a href=\"mailto:irb@healthstudy.edu\">irb@healthstudy.edu<\/a> for any of the following:<ul><li>If your questions, concerns, or complaints are not being answered by the research team, <\/li><li>If you cannot reach the research team, <\/li><li>If you want to talk to someone besides the research team, <\/li><li>If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, or<\/li><li>If you want to get information or provide input about this research. <\/li><\/ul><b>Participation is voluntary<\/b>You are invited to take part in this research because you are a former NFL player. It is your choice whether or not to participate. If you choose to participate, you may change your mind and leave the study at<br\/> any time. Refusal to participate or stopping your participation will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you<br\/> are otherwise entitled.\r\n\r\n<b>How many people will take part in this research?<\/b>\r\nAbout 4,000 people will take part in this research.\r\n\r\n<b>What can I expect if I take part in this research?<\/b>\r\nAs a participant, you will be expected to complete questionnaires as part of the longitudinal study.\r\n\r\n<b>What are the risks and possible discomforts?<\/b>\r\nThe risks may include loss of privacy and confidentiality, and as such, the Study takes extensive steps to protect your information, as detailed below in the section 'If I take part in this research, how will my privacy be protected?'\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some of the questions may cause discomfort or emotional distress. If you encounter any of these feelings, please contact the <a href=\"https:\/\/nfllifeline.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">NFL LifeLine<\/a> at 1-800-506-0078, a confidential resource for current and former NFL players and<br\/> their families, or the Football Players Health Study team at 617-432-5000. The study team may be able to answer any questions you have about the research or can refer you to additional resources for support.\r\n\r\n<b>Are there any benefits from being in this research study?<\/b>\r\nThere are no direct benefits to you from your participation in this research. We cannot promise any benefits to others<br\/> from your participation in this research. However, by giving us a better understanding of your life and health status, it<br\/> is the starting point for developing follow-up studies to assess various health problems of former players in more detail.<br\/> We hope that this work will lead to earlier interventions for football-related health problems, minimize long-term health problems, and lead to a better quality of life for former players, as well as for future generations of players.\r\n\r\n<b>What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?<\/b>\r\nYou can leave the research at any time it will not be held against you.\r\n\r\n<b>Will I be compensated for participating in this research?<\/b>\r\nYou will not be compensated for your participation in this research, but after completing the survey, you will have the chance to enter a drawing for one of several $100 gift cards.<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>What will I have to pay for if I participate in this research?<\/b>\r\nIt will not cost you anything to participate in this research.\r\n\r\n<b>If I take part in this research, how will my privacy be protected? What happens to the information you collect?<\/b>\r\nEfforts will be made to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, including research study and medical records, to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete secrecy. Organizations<br\/> that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB. We have taken the following additional precautions:<ul><br\/><li>The questionnaire responses will not include your name. <\/li><li>Questionnaire responses are identified by a unique code only identifiable to the researchers. <\/li><li>We will store your information in a secure database. Only a limited number of people will have access to this database. Our team is trained to handle highly confidential data. <\/li><li>We will not identify you in any publication or presentation without your permission. <\/li><li>We have obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality issued by the National Institutes of Health of the U.S.<br\/> Department of Health and Human Services<\/li><\/ul>\r\nThis research is covered by a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. This adds special protection<\/br> for the research information that may identify you. The researchers may not disclose information that may identify you,<\/br> even under a court order or subpoena, unless you give permission.\r\n\r\nHowever, a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent researchers from disclosing your information if required by law<\/br> (such as to report child or elder abuse, communicable diseases or harm to self or others); if you have consented (agreed) to<\/br> the disclosure (such as for your medical treatment); or for use in other research as allowed by law.\r\n\r\nThe Certificate does not stop you from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement<\/br> in this research. <b>However, to more fully protect your confidentiality, it may be better<\/br> to state that you support the Football Players Health Study in general terms, rather than making<\/br> specific statements like, \"I have completed the Football Players Health Study questionnaire.\"<\/b>\r\n\r\nIf you want your research information released to anyone not connected with the research, you must provide consent<\/br> to allow the researchers to release it. If others obtain your written consent to receive research information, then the<\/br> researchers are permitted, but not necessarily required to disclose that information.\r\n\r\n<b>Can I be removed from the research without my OK?<\/b>\r\nThe person in charge of the research study or the sponsor can remove you from the research study without your<br\/> approval if you are found to be ineligible for the study after submitting a questionnaire.\r\n\r\n<b>What else do I need to know?<\/b>\r\nThis research is an initiative developed by players, for players. It began in 2014 in part through an award from the<br\/> National Football League Players Association (NFLPA). The Study largely utilizes funds allocated for the research by<br\/> the collective bargaining agreement with the NFL. Multiple Harvard- affiliated institutions are also sharing the cost<br\/> of the initiative.\r\n\r\nThe Football Players Health Study includes many research studies. We may combine the information collected from you during this study with results from other Football Players Health Study research studies that you have been involved in. Your information may also be connected to any future Football Players Health Study projects that you are a part of. This includes studies that may be done by other researchers who work with the Football Players Health Study. We do not know how many future studies we will have, but there will be many over several years. When you participate in a Football Players Health Study research study, you are agreeing to allow us to collect and store the data from the project for several years. This is useful and important as it allows us to look at changes in health and wellness over time in former football players.\r\n\r\nWe may use information collected from you during this or other Football Players Health Study research studies to determine future research that you may be eligible to participate in. We will use your personal information in order to contact and inform you about these opportunities.\r\n\r\nYour name and personal information (information that can identify you) are connected to a code that the Football Players Health Study has assigned to you. This code is connected to the data that is collected from you in any Football Players Health Study research study that you participate in (for example, answers to questionnaires, medical history or results of a scan). The key to this code is stored in a secure file that is kept separate from your study data. Only trained members of the Football Players Health Study staff will have access to the key to this code. All of your personal information is stored in a secure database at Harvard separately from the study results.\r\n\r\nThe Football Players Health Study works with other local researchers or researchers in other states or countries. If a researcher wants to use data from the Football Players Health Study, they must make a request in writing describing what type of research they want to do and what type of information they need. These proposals will be reviewed and approved by a committee of Football Players Health Study researchers. In most cases, we will share information that is assigned a code and the researcher will not receive any information that can identify you.\r\n\r\nThere will be occasions that a researcher working with us will require access to your personal information. For example, if we are working with a researcher who is doing in-person research, they may need your name and contact information to make arrangements for you to come for the study. In such cases, we will not share the information without first contacting you to see if you are interested in the specific study and to get your permission to share your personal information. \r\n\r\n<b>Statement of Consent<\/b>\r\nI have read the information in this consent form including risks and possible benefits. All my questions about the<br\/> research have been answered to my satisfaction. I understand that I am free to withdraw at any time without penalty<br\/> or loss of benefits to which I am otherwise entitled.\r\n\r\n<b>I consent to participate in the study<\/b>\r\n<\/span>\r\nFollow the link below to download a copy of this consent form.",
